Citizen is a free app that keeps you and your loved ones safe. It is a powerful force for good that has already evacuated people from burning buildings, diverted school buses from nearby terrorist attacks and reunited missing children with their parents.

Using our unique technology, 911 alerts are made available to the public and are accompanied by live stories, real-time updates, and user-generated content to provide you with the information you need to protect yourself and your loved ones.

Our Challenges
Scaling: We have one of the fastest-growing organic user bases in NYC, and have expanded to multiple other cities. We are focused on the nationwide launch and the need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
Bursting: We designed our infrastructure to scale without notice in case of a spontaneous incident where we need to inform our entire user base. On significant events, we see over a million simultaneously connected clients and their associated live streams. The core systems need to be able to efficiently support these traffic patterns and continue to scale to millions of more users in the future.
Machine learning: We process thousands of hours of audio every day looking for incidents that impact our users' safety. To do this at scale, we've built ML models for audio analysis and targeting using the current state of the art from academia.
Analytics: We want to alert users to the incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
Radio hardware: We build our own software-defined radio-based devices to consume all radio dispatch in every major city, whether analog or digital.

Sisu leverages the massive amounts of data available within private, first-party data warehouses, which capture a real-time, structured view of organizational behavior. By monitoring the performance of key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn, and their relationships to interactions between key factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels, we can help users make better decisions.

Scanalytics Inc. is looking for a Data Scientist able to construct physics-based models to process data from our sensor mats. This is not a black-box-algorithm kind of role. Customers want more than data they want insight. And the explanation of how a result was calculated is as important as the result itself. The Data Scientist role helps Scanalytics derive these insights from raw sensor data; essentially extracting information from a high-resolution video of pressure on a floor. This role transforms sensor readings into anonymized insights about activity in a space.

Key Responsibilities:
Develop and evaluate computational models for people-counting and identifying behaviors on smart mats
Implement these models in code, so that they are call-able from a Python framework
Communicate model characteristics and performance to technical and non-technical associates
Create charts to visualize raw data and model performance
Provide analytical feedback on IoT hardware iterations such as sensor performance, stability, and consistency
Qualifications:
Bachelor's degree in STEM field (post-graduate degree or equivalent experience a plus)
Demonstrated history of data analysis and model development, e.g. for time-series or IoT data
Strong background and understanding of statistics; ability to flag statistically significant events especially outliers and anomalies
Experience building models to consume data from a continuous stream of events
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Who you are:
Interest in understanding human behavior patterns (e.g., why did this group of people enter to the left instead of the right?)
Independent worker who is a specialist within a small team
Will run experiments and test algorithm performance in terms of correctly counting occupancy on the mat and perimeter crossings (i.e., entrances and exits)
Communicate and formally report on results, needed improvements and requirements to hardware team and Chief Scientist, and Dont Be Afraid to Speak Up on setting expectations of algorithm performance and enjoining team to run testing when needed
Have a Get Shit Done attitude that means you bring algorithms to a state of completion rather than perfection, so that they can be deployed to our customers
Demonstrate Practical Curiosity to understand how the analytics fit into the rest of the business and how to create even better and more useable sensors
Perks & Benefits:
Startup culture: lots of autonomy, mastery and purpose in everything in you do with plentiful opportunities to grow
No dress code, no layers of management and no rigidity in your role

At CMT, a Data Scientist has the opportunity to work on an extremely wide variety of technical areas. We collect high-volume, high-velocity data generated from smartphone and IoT sensors in vehicles. We clean, normalize and fuse multiple data sources using time series signal processing techniques, handing noise, censoring, and non-uniform sampling. Next, we determine which behaviors might indicate risky driving, using robust statistical analyses and feature engineering. We produce an estimate of aggregate driving risk using GLMs and ML regressors. Finally, given the risk estimate, we determine how we can most effectively help drivers modify and improve their driving by performing experiments and mining data.

Overview

DrivenData brings the transformative power of data science to organizations tackling the world’s biggest challenges. We run online machine learning challenges with social impact, and we work directly with mission-driven organizations to drive change through data science and engineering.

We are looking for a skilled data scientist who is interested in using their job to take on tough social challenges, grow their skillset, and build real-world applications. As a core member of a small team your role will include writing code (Python) everyday, brainstorming approaches to data science problems, working closely with other data scientists and engineers on the team, and taking an open and constructive mindset to getting things done across multiple projects.

We pride ourselves on being a great place to work and to learn. We take the development of our team members very seriously and we value the priorities that we each have in our lives at work and outside of work. We like to tackle problems that matter as a team. We help each other develop clean, well-organized, well-documented code in service of correct and reproducible data science. We believe the work we do should positively impact people’s lives.

We’re different because we focus on delivering solutions. We are not a research lab or product company—instead, we work directly with organizations to build data capabilities that they can start using now.

Additional details
Strong proficiency in Python a necessity, especially the Python data science stack
Experience developing data science models, workflows, and software for real world applications and working with imperfect data
Working on a small team means doing a little bit of a lot of things. We're looking for somebody who can ask the right questions to figure out what is important, iterate between brainstorming together and working independently, and exercise sound judgment to make reasonable decisions under conditions of ambiguity.
Communication is a core data science skill at DrivenData. Doing client-facing work involves articulating concepts, interpreting results, and selecting the method that satisfies the constraints of the project.
Working with non-expert organizations means me need to turn uncertainty into a reasonable path forward. As a team, we value arguments for how to proceed based on evidence, and we want somebody who will present their opinion and engage in a discussion around the best way forward—especially when that takes into account the broader context of the project.
We value a positive attitude and the ability to adapt, learn, and collaborate.
We embrace the individuality of our employees and we celebrate each other's differences. Our work benefits from and thrives on the unique perspectives brought by each person on our team. We're proud to be an equal opportunity workplace, and we are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, age, sex, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship, marital status, disability, or Veteran status.
Here are some of the things you'd be doing on an ordinary day:
Exploratory analysis, modeling, and visualization in Jupyter notebooks
Integrating data sources, creating subsets (ex. train/test) for modeling, and assessing potential datasets, tools, and approaches
Translating the results of analysis into implications for people and problems
Developing well-organized code that can be collaboratively reviewed, reproduced, and integrated into applications
Quickly assessing and becoming productive in relevant new technologies and methods
Requirements

Applicants must be authorized to work in the United States.

Critical skills
Proficient in Python and proven ability to work pragmatically with statistical concepts
Experience with core data science tools (ex. pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, jupyter)
Working familiarity with software development tools and practices (Git, code review, etc.)
Experience working with messy data and real-world applications
Strong interpersonal and communication skills
Nice to have
Experience using IaaS like Amazon AWS
Experience building data-driven applications including backend and frontend technologies
Benefits

We offer competitive salary and benefits including flexible work and unlimited vacation, health coverage, 401(k) matching, and choice in the computing equipment you use.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Consider as Advantages:
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.

Related to this goal, the Bioinformatics Programmer/Data Scientist will assist in managing, cleaning and analyzing large scale medical data using a wide variety of analytic techniques. The Data Scientist will be involved in developing software pipelines, mostly using Python, for data extraction which will need to be developed de novo to obtain data from various clinical systems or sources. Once the data is obtained, pipelines will be created to clean the data and store the data in file-systems appropriate for the size of the data at hand. Experience with databases or the ability to learn will be requisite. Under the supervision of the PI, the Data Scientist will also be involved in data analysis, and will be fluent in comparing a variety of techniques, including machine learning and deep learning techniques, to be able to empirically determine which approach is most suitable for the given research hypothesis and data type. The ability to learn and implement new techniques depending on the problem at hand will be an essential skill, thus requiring a strong foundation in Python and competency to bootstrap novel algorithmic implementations as needs arise. This position may also include some administrative duties and will have the opportunity to participate in and lead authorship teams.

The Company:

Our client is a highly recognized leader in the AI driven RPA software space, an emerging form of business process automation technology based on the notion of software robots or artificial intelligence (AI) workers. Unlike traditional workflow automation tools RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the applications graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.

RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems including features that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving email containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a bookkeeping system

The Company:

Our client is a highly recognized leader in the AI driven RPA software space, an emerging form of business process automation technology based on the notion of software robots or artificial intelligence (AI) workers. Unlike traditional workflow automation tools RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the applications graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.

RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems including features that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving email containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a bookkeeping system

The need is for multiple Data Scientists who also are versed in Machine Learning.
